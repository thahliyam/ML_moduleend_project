This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning techniques by analyzing various car attributes such as engine size, curb weight, fuel efficiency, and horsepower. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data. Feature selection methods, including SelectKBest and correlation analysis, identified engine size, curb weight, and highway MPG as the most influential factors. Several machine learning models—Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression (SVR)—were trained and evaluated using performance metrics like R² Score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Among these, Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model with an R² of 0.955, followed by Gradient Boosting (0.919) and Decision Tree (0.886), while SVR underperformed due to data non-linearity. The findings highlight the significant role of engine specifications and vehicle dimensions in determining car prices, making this model valuable for car manufacturers, dealers, and buyers in making informed pricing decisions.
